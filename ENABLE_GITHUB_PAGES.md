# Enable GitHub Pages - Step by Step

## The Issue
You're getting a 404 because GitHub Pages needs to be enabled in your repository settings.

## Quick Fix (2 minutes)

### Step 1: Go to Pages Settings
Open this URL in your browser:
**https://github.com/NicholasBelschner/spendsmart-website/settings/pages**

### Step 2: Configure Pages
1. Under **"Source"** section:
   - Select **"Deploy from a branch"**
   - **Branch**: Select `main`
   - **Folder**: Select `/ (root)`
   
2. Click **"Save"**

### Step 3: Wait (1-2 minutes)
GitHub needs a moment to build and deploy your site. You'll see a message like:
> "Your site is live at https://nicholasbelschner.github.io/spendsmart-website/"

### Step 4: Check Status
After saving, you should see:
- A green checkmark ✅
- Your site URL displayed
- "Your site is published at..." message

## Troubleshooting

### Still 404 after enabling?
- Wait 2-3 minutes (GitHub needs time to build)
- Check the "Pages" tab in your repo for build status
- Make sure the repository is **PUBLIC** (required for free GitHub Pages)

### Check if Pages is enabled:
Go to: https://github.com/NicholasBelschner/spendsmart-website/settings/pages

You should see:
- ✅ "Your site is published at..."
- Source: `main` branch, `/ (root)` folder
